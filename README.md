# Final Assignment Algorithms and AI

## What is this assignment?

## What have I implemented?


## Simulation Options
I have added some options to the simulation to get insights in what is happening. I have done this with toggles (checkboxes) for each option.
These toggles are disabled on default.
| Name | Details  |
|-----|----------|
|  Behavior  | This shows all current goals in the Brain  |
|  Location Details  | This shows the Occuptation state of the Location (Warehouse, PetrolStation etc)   |
|  Force  | This shows the force that is put on the entity to move around |
|  Graph  | This shows the graph. This graph is used for the pathplanning. You will also see the shortestPath and visited nodes |
|  Entity Simplified  | This is usefull to see the Force a lot better on the entity. Also useful if you dont like my fancy shuttles :P | 
|  Stats  | This shows the stats of the Moving Entities. These Stats are Fuel and Wear. This is quite usefull to see in combination with the Behaviour toggle enabled |
