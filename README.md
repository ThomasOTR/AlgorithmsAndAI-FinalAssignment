# Final Assignment Algorithms and AI

## What is this assignment?
This is an Assignment for my Algorithms and AI class on my HBO-ICT study on Windesheim. In this assignment I have made a simulation with a space theme. For this simulation I have implemented several techniques which helped to make this simulation as it is.
## What have I implemented?
I've worked on several parts for this assignment
-Steering Behaviors
-Behavior of Entities
-Fuzzy Logic
-Path Planning
## Simulation Options
I have added some options to the simulation to get insights in what is happening. I have done this with toggles (checkboxes) for each option.
These toggles are disabled on default.
| Name | Details  |
|-----|----------|
|  Behavior  | This shows all current goals in the Brain  |
|  Location Details  | This shows the Occuptation state of the Location (Warehouse, PetrolStation etc)   |
|  Force  | This shows the force that is put on the entity to move around |
|  Graph  | This shows the graph. This graph is used for the pathplanning. You will also see the shortestPath and visited nodes |
|  Entity Simplified  | This is usefull to see the Force a lot better on the entity. Also useful if you dont like my fancy shuttles :P | 
|  Stats  | This shows the stats of the Moving Entities. These Stats are Fuel and Wear. This is quite usefull to see in combination with the Behaviour toggle enabled |

## Used Assets
I've used the following assets for my simulation:
Space breaker: https://zintoki.itch.io/space-breaker
Tiny Planet Pack: https://screamingbrainstudios.itch.io/tiny-planet-pack
Ultimate Space Game Mega Asset Pack: https://gamesupply.itch.io/ultimate-space-game-mega-asset-package
